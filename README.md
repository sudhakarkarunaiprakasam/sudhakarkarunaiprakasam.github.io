# **Sudhakar's Notebook**

Welcome to my **Personal Blog**. Feel free to browse around.

It is mostly intended for my Personal Knowledge Management similar to Zettlekasten or Second Brain.

## **Notebooks**

This is the notes I'm taking while reading. They are categorized into larger topics.

1. [business](business.md)
2. [economics](economics.md)
3. [productManagement](productManagement.md)
4. [communication](communication.md)
5. [psychology](psychology.md)
6. [design](design.md)
7. [skillDevelopment](skillDevelopment.md)

**Note**: If this blog looks odd, It's because I'm taking a hands-on approach. I'm writing entire blog in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) with the help of [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosting at [GitHub](https://github.com/sudhakarkarunaiprakasam/sudhakarkarunaiprakasam.github.io).

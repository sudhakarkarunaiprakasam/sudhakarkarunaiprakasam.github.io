# **Sudhakar's Notebook**

Welcome to my **Personal Blog**. Feel free to browse around.

## [**Business Kit**](BusinessKit.md)

I wanted to an MBA to gain more insights into the business and the world economy. But I can't afford an MBA like most of the people I know. So I'm taking a hands-on approach towards gaining business skills. I love reading and teaching complex stuffs into simpler stories. I want to take that approach towards learning business skills. So here we go.

I learn as much as could and then I'm going to write them into books. The project is inspired by **Josh Kaufmann**'s [**Personal MBA**](https://personalmba.com/). Writing them into small books with some narrative story is inspired by [**Professor Aswath Damodaran**](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/)

Current Structure looks like:

1. Business Basics
2. Micro-Economics
3. Corporate Finance
4. Macro-Economics
5. Investing

**Note**: If this blog looks odd, It's because I'm taking a hands-on approach. I'm writing entire blog in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) with the help of [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosting at [GitHub](https://github.com/sudhakarkarunaiprakasam/sudhakarkarunaiprakasam.github.io).

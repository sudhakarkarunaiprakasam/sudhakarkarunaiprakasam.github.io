# **Sudhakar's Notebook**

Welcome to my **Personal Blog**. Feel free to browse around.

## [**Business Kit**](BusinessKit.md)

I believe the future is going to be full of **Creators, Entrepreneurs, Freelancers and Consultants** than the standard 9 to 5 Jobs. I want to support them with basic business kit. I like reading big bulky books and condense them into digestable concepts. The most important project I'm currently working on.

## [**Book Summaries**](BookSummaries.md)

To do [Business Kit](BusinessKit.md) project well, I've to read lots of books. When I get something significant out of the book, I'll try to write them. It is mostly my reflections and take aways from them book.

## [**Other Essays**](OtherEssays.md)

The Essays that doesn't fit to above criteria are filled here. When some topic is getting repeated frequently, It will get its own category.

**Note**: If this blog looks odd, It's because I'm taking a hands-on approach. I'm writing in markdown with the help of [Mkdocs with Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosting at [GitHub](https://github.com/sudhakarkarunaiprakasam/sudhakarkarunaiprakasam.github.io).

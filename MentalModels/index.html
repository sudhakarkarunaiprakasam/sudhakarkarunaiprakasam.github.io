<h1 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h1>
<h2 id="on-mental-models">On Mental Models</h2>
<p><em>Refer Shane Parrish, Scott Page, Josh Kaufman</em></p>
<p>We all have mental models in out head. Those are formed based on out life experiences and unique for every individual. The mental models are the shortcuts, flowcharts or simplified view of the system we use to make decisions.</p>
<p>Mental model could be anything and everything. For example, I mostly drive my bike at 50-60 kmph speed even in highways. I feel in that speed I can control the bike most of the cases. This is the mental model for my driving. It could be different for different people.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It helps with making decisions quickly. Charlie Munger reportedly can make business decisions within a minute it is presented with the help of his latticework of mental models.</li>
<li>Once we get better at the process of decision making with mental models, we can have more leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One model thinking may not work that well and which model to apply is not so straight forward. Need to have lot of mental models and apply them in various combinations to get effective output.</li>
<li>Need to get feedback and iterate for long time to get better at the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="acquiring-new-skills">Acquiring New Skills</h2>
<p><em>Refer Naval Ravikant, Cal Newport</em></p>
<p>The kind of people most likely to thrive in the digital economy are,</p>
<ol>
<li>Superstars one their fields</li>
<li>People who can work well with technologies to produce outputs,</li>
<li>Investors and Venture Capitalists who can spot the trend.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important quality required to thrive in this economy is the ability to learn things quickly and ability to produce at the highest quality. Most of the technologies get to their peak in years and go out of trend less than a decade. We should develop our ability to perform at the professional level within few months and we can get very rich within few years. But the technology will go down quickly and we should be ready to repeat the process many times throughout our career. It is directly opposite to the previous generation where people figure out the things they are good at and do the same job till they retire.</p>
<h2 id="skill-stacking">Skill Stacking</h2>
<p><em>Refer Scott Adams, Josh Kaufman, Naval Ravikant</em></p>
<p>As discussed already, we should learn and produce output using new technologies quickly and we can earn big bucks.</p>
<p>There are some reservations with this approach because there are lot of things are one trend at any particular moment. For example, the current trending topics are DeFi, Web3, Cloud, Machine Learning, etc. In this kind of situation how can one person go about picking new skills.</p>
<p>As Scott Adams calls it, Talent Stacking is the way where we can be decently skilled at few adjacent fields such a way that we can be best at what we do. We can combine our average level skills strategically to be top most person at one particular combination of skills. Some of the skills Scott Adams recommends people to get good are Persuasion, Public Speaking, Psychology, Business Writing, Technology, Overcoming Shyness, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers." - Naval Ravikant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Personal MBA, Josh Kaufman classifies the Business into five parts,</p>
<ol>
<li>Value Creation</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Value Delivery</li>
<li>Finance</li>
</ol>
<p>The skills relevant to those 5 areas of business can be financially rewarding. We can't get rich by the skills that support other areas of business like supporting departments like maintenance, administration, etc.</p>
<p>One important thing we need to know about the skill before picking up is to understand how scalable it is. A programmer can right a piece of code and automate it with very less cost. The content creator can share the content they produce worldwide without any marginal cost of replication.</p>
<h2 id="corporate-finance-first-principles">Corporate Finance First Principles</h2>
<p><em>Refer Aswath Damodaran, Josh Kaufman</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's all Corporate Finance" - Aswath Damodaran</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every decision in a business involves money and any decision that affects money is a corporate finance decision. Cash is the blood that runs the business (I've heard people say it is Free Cash Flow, I need to learn further on the topic).</p>
<p>In Josh Kaufman's 5 parts of Business, Finance is the one that runs all others. All the decisions are taken based on the money one business have/can invest and what it is willing to gain?</p>
<p>The three important finance decisions a business need to take are,</p>
<ol>
<li>Investment Decision (Risk vs Return)</li>
<li>Financing Decision (Debt vs Equity)</li>
<li>Dividend Decision (Buyback vs Dividend)</li>
</ol>
<p>All those decisions are guided by single objective of the business, that is what the business wants to do?</p>
<h2 id="corporate-finance-objective">Corporate Finance Objective</h2>
<p><em>Refer Aswath Damodaran</em></p>
<p>The reason the business exists and people work for it day and night is to make money. Helping Society should be part of the package, but not at the cost of profit. The objective of the corporate finance is to <strong>maximize the value of the firm</strong>.</p>
<p>We can interpret the above objective in many different ways and each business interpret in their own way. We can maximize the value of the business by increasing market share, revenue, profit margin, customer satisfaction, etc. We can improve productivity by giving better incentives to employees. We can do good to society along the way and extract the good will in the form of business.</p>
<p>There are lot of stakeholders and lot of ways to increase the value of the firm. But the problem in the real world is we can't focus on multiple ways as they are contradicting one another. We cannot satisfy all the stakeholders and we must clearly pick one single objective and work on it.</p></div>

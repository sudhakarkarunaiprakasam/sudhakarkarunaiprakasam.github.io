Yesterday I met the second person whoi want to know about the status of the blog. Things were busy for the past 1 month with house shifting. Will resume my good work from this week. Lot of exciting things are on the way. First set of books I'm reading are for self improvement. All the good things started when I wanted to explore what is the value I can provide for society. Day by day I'm getting somewhat clear idea about economically valuable skills and how to gain them. So the books I'm starting with are Cal Newport's So Good They Can't Ignore You , Deep Work , Seth Godin's Startup School , Scott Adams' How to fail at everything and Still win Big and Peter Thiel's Zero to One . One thing about Zero To One is I can understand the book is holding some secret from me that I'm not able to comprehend now. Will take another shot at summarizing the book. As Scott Adams would say \"Don't let go the failure simply, extract some value out of it\". I strongly believe good things will come to those who are ready to receive. I am getting ready, one word at a time. So Good They Can't Ignore You Author starts with the controversial idea called \"Don't follow your passion\". I liked his examples. We like passionate people who are winning medals and awards. I strongly disagree with the author's understanding with Steve Jobs \"Follow your passion\" speech. Steve clearly mentions we can Connect the dots only looking backwards . Cal Newport also arriving at the same conclusion where we get better at doing things when we have enough confidence and skills to perform our tasks. He calls the idea as \"Career Capital\". I started this book to figure out the skills worth learning. This entire blog is motivated to find about what are the economically valuable skills an individual can have. So this book fits perfectly into my exploration. Lets look into Career Capital , the author calls it as Set of Rare and Valuable Skills . How can one go about acquiring those skills. As said before, we can Connect the dots only looking backwards . For example, I'm more interested in story telling. Initially I've burnt my hand with painting. After that most of my life revolves around reading the books and watching complex videos and speak to people about them in a simplified manner. I was happy with feeling superior to them and they are happy with not wasting times with those boring stuff. The story doesn't continue such way once I've joined the college. In campus, it was like I was the dumbest person. So I sticked to discussing movie stories and funny one liners. At that time I didn't know that I'm losing the thing that completes me. When I started working, here the things went back to normal. Here also people preferred simplified stories for complex socio-political issues. I sticked to the topic people want to know about, mostly the day's headline new incident. Now that I look back and reflect, I can easily say the thing I'm passionate about is telling stories. Not the boring Boy meets a Girl type stories. The ones that are happening at the real time. The digestable version of what makes people wake up in the morning. For most of the cases people wake up and show up to office because they have expenses to bear with at the end of the month. But what makes people like Bill Gates to take up all the negative comments and still want to do some change in society. Even today Warren Buffett goes to his office daily and do his job at 90. Of course it is for money but is there anything more to it?","title":"Mind Garden"},{"location":"mindGarden/#mind-garden","text":"","title":"Mind Garden"},{"location":"mindGarden/#29april2022","text":"Getting ready after almost 4 months.

On Second Brain (05/April/2022) (Isaac Newton, Richard Feynman, Niklas Luhmann, Sonke Aherns, Charlie Munger, Naval Ravikant, TIm Ferriss) (It's all connected, about Marshmallow test, Grit, then write about Second Brain and Deep Work) (Ikigai, Secrets, Definite Optimism) You might be already knowing that I started this blog 3 months ago and if you go to homepage, there is very few posts. You may think like probably I've given up the blog. You're correct in some way. Initial plan for this blog was to post some thing every week. My plan is based on the assumption that I can confortably type out 1000 word essay in an hour or two. So weekly once seems like a good plan. Problem with that plan is the series of work involved before I start typing. Like I've to decide on what to write about, what are the references I need. Another problem with the idea of me posting an essay about any topics is \"who am I to tell people about stuff?\", the age old imposter symptom. It's not like I don't know anything. It's just I don't know how to translate my readings, my thoughts and opinions into words. The problem we all have since we started our schooling. Math teacher don't care about your Physics topics, Biology teacher don't bother about Chemistry, or whatever. From childhood, we've trained to think in silos. All our knowledge is tied to some abstract classification. When we try to connect the pieces of knowledge from two different pieces, we get stuck. FOr example, let me talk about the essay I'm currently writing. Inspiration for this essay came from two main sources. One is podcast called Building a Second Brain and another one is a book called How to Take Smart Notes . As a professional engineer, I can say No two parts are same . Some ideas are similar, some taken from same sources, some ideas are introduced to overcome difficulties in the old methods and obviously, there are some huge differences between both the works. At some points, I don;t agree with both of them, means I've some pre conceived thoughts already. Now the task is to compile all of them into single piece of work. As you can confirm from the rambling in this paragraph. Let me start. I need a system to solve the above problem. A way to compare, contradict and compile the single source of truth, my truth. I also need another system. A system to collect all my pre existing knowledge and adjust it to my newly found truth. You might be knowing about my plan to self learn the business skills instead of going to college. Problem with business books is, most of the books have same few ideas, with different point of views. We can't blame them, as there is no single skill called Business and people from multiple discipline form their knowledge based on their own experiences and needs, and No two people are same. Let the past things past, I need a way to catalogue and index the ideas I'm learning now. SO tnat when I face a similar concept in the future, I can either connect it with my existing knowledge or contradict and have a rational discussion based on it. Charlie Munger is an huge inspiration for me and for may others. One of the important quality he have is to evaluate the business deals he comes across in less that 60 seconds. You may know about his business partner, Warren Buffett. While we may not be able to take billion dollar investments under 60 seconds, we all have to take decisions on daily basis. Even a smaller things like when to pay phone bill. There are two options, either I can pay it now, or I can wait til the last day. If I choose second option, I've got a problem. I've to remember the last date. I'm too lazy to spend 10 seconds to make aremainder in my phone. At that time, I'll think I can remember anything. I can even remember the colour of my shirt I wore on my 10th Birthday. Funny fact is I've trouble remembering what I ate for breakfast today, That took me more than 30 seconds. As I said, I want to be like Charlie Munger and all his worldly wisdoms. When asked, Munger pointed out the reason for his efficiency is something called his Latticework of Mental Models . He never listed out what are the mental models he's using, I got caught on the idea of Mental Models. Next time I've heard about the mental model is from Naval Ravikant, another successful investor. But the working nature of both the personalities are vastly different. Munger invests in well established publicly trading companies like Apple and Coca-Cola. Naval is an early stage investor who funds exclusivly for startups. The third time I've came across the same idea is from totally unexpected place. A professor from Germany used the system called Zettelkasten to publish around 70 books and 100 of articles. Let me point out the common things between all those ideas below. But feel free to omit or add you own stuff to sui your needs.

Collected Dots I like Charlie Munger for his ability to take big decisions that can affect even world economy. Charlie Munger reportedly can analyze any business proposal presented to him within a minute. He attributed these skills to the Latticework of Mental Models he have them inside his head.

Idea is to teach myself at least one model per day. I follow simplified Zettelkasten method and this is a kind of digital slip-box. Almost all of these ideas are based on the books I'm reading.

On How to get Rich Short summary of The Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson Wealth = Specific Knowledge + Accountability + Leverage Wealth is the asset that can earn while we sleep. Wealth is fundamentally different from Status & Money. Money is your bank balance that is loosing its value due to inflation. Status is the game we used to play for gallery for moral high ground instead of well being of oneself and others. Specific Knowledge is the innate talent, passion or the thing we like & do well. Specific Knowledge is our favourite hobby that other people are willing to pay for. To make other pay, we need to apply our skills in a way it provides value to the people. As long as we are good at our chosen field and enjoy putting more productive time into it, people will pay willingly. The specific knowledge is not necessarily a single skill. It can be a collection of skills that are combined to provide a single form of value to the customer. For example, Scott Adams is an average cartoonist. But when he combined it with his bank/corporate experience, persuasion, witty one liners, he is the best talent in his field. Scott Adams calls this process as Talent Stacking . Accountability People pay more for branded things in a hope that it is a quality product. Trust is the most important thing in business and even in real life. Almost all the things in personal life, career have compound effect built into it. The only way to attract the compound effect into our life is by being accountable. Being accountable doesn't mean going out of the way to help people. We can establish accountability simply by making the promise and keeping them unbroken. For example, I hereby promise I'm going to write everyday till end of this year. Leverage Specific Knowledge helps you enter the market, Accountability helps you be in the market without being left out. In other words, we can create value with the help of Specific Knowledge and deliver the promised value aka Accountability. These two qualities will help us pay the bills, but it may not account for more than that. When you combine those two qualities with Leverage, you can grow exponentially. The common forms of leverage are Capital, Labour, Code, Media. Choose the one based on your preference and you are good to go. Note: I didn't add Judgement as one of the element in this equation because it comes under our specific knowledge. In the age of Knowledge workers, taking decisions is part of the job description.

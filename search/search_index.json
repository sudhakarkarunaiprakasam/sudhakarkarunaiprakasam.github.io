Become a Career Capitalist . Career Capital is Set of Rare and Economically Valuable Skills . Work like a Craftsman ( Deliberate Practice) . Navigate carefully around Control Traps . Have a Mission. Missions require Capital, Small Bets, Marketing . Summary Following your own passion is overrated. If you ask about passion, almost everyone will say about arts, sports, etc. No one is passionate about being a office clerk or assistant. Yet we all (like 99%) end up working in those boring jobs all our life. It is not that we are not failures. It doesn't mean we can't do well in our profession. In fact for me, my interest in my day job increased after I've completed one year already. Now I'm happy with the work I do, the same work I've picked up as my last option. Passion is for Losers, as Scott Adams would say in his book . Instead focus on Economically Valuable Skills . List of those skills are available from Scott Adams , Naval Ravikant & Personal MBA . How to go about getting these skills is the real challenge. As I mentioned before, we don't know what work we like unless we try it. But we can't try all the jobs available. As Steve Jobs said, \" We can connect the dots only looking backwards. \" One idea to collect the skills is to find a base skill. As per Scott Adams & Naval Ravikant , this is the things we like to do when we were young. I'm talking about passion. But only as a base skill over which we can build a career. After finding your own base skill, you should find other skills or areas adjacent to that. According to Scott Adams, Every additional skill we acquire will double our odds of success. In this book, Cal Newport talks about those skills as our own Career Capital. The main advantage of career capital is almost all the innovations in our field happens at the edge of the knowledge and where one field connects with another. That is why most of the critical innovations are invented by two or more people around the same time. The real value of career capital is our ability to bring ideas from one field and apply it in other. Next point the book makes is about Craftsmanship. It is not enough if we only become competent in our skills. Almost all the action takes place in bleeding edge of the knowledge in that field. We can go about becoming better at what we do is only by Deliberate Practice. As Malcolm Gladwell would say, it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something. Once we have enough Career Capital, we have to focus on making the mark in the world on our own. There are two important control traps we should avoid as per the author. We should not start on our own before acquiring enough career capital. Once we have enough competence, the people we work for won't simple allow us to resign and start our own shop. Try to navigate without burning any bridge. Having an unifying mission is the best way to go about our venture. We can connect the dots only looking backward, as already mentioned. Next thing after collecting the career skills, we should start with Small Bets. The magic of thinking big may sound attractive at first sight. But we cannot make a mark unless we have experience. So start with small bets and get gradually bigger ones. Along the way, we have to talk about marketing our self, as it is very important in the social media age to attract the necessary friends or partners to work with.","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport"},{"location":"soGoodTheyCantIgnore/#so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-by-cal-newport","text":"Don't follow your passion .

On Second Brain (05/April/2022) (Isaac Newton, Richard Feynman, Niklas Luhmann, Sonke Aherns, Charlie Munger, Naval Ravikant, TIm Ferriss) (It's all connected, about Marshmallow test, Grit, then write about Second Brain and Deep Work) (Ikigai, Secrets, Definite Optimism) You might be already knowing that I started this blog 3 months ago and if you go to homepage, there is very few posts. You may think like probably I've given up the blog. You're correct in some way. Initial plan for this blog was to post some thing every week. My plan is based on the assumption that I can confortably type out 1000 word essay in an hour or two. So weekly once seems like a good plan. Problem with that plan is the series of work involved before I start typing. Like I've to decide on what to write about, what are the references I need. Another problem with the idea of me posting an essay about any topics is \"who am I to tell people about stuff?\", the age old imposter symptom. It's not like I don't know anything. It's just I don't know how to translate my readings, my thoughts and opinions into words. The problem we all have since we started our schooling. Math teacher don't care about your Physics topics, Biology teacher don't bother about Chemistry, or whatever. From childhood, we've trained to think in silos. All our knowledge is tied to some abstract classification. When we try to connect the pieces of knowledge from two different pieces, we get stuck. FOr example, let me talk about the essay I'm currently writing. Inspiration for this essay came from two main sources. One is podcast called Building a Second Brain and another one is a book called How to Take Smart Notes . As a professional engineer, I can say No two parts are same . Some ideas are similar, some taken from same sources, some ideas are introduced to overcome difficulties in the old methods and obviously, there are some huge differences between both the works. At some points, I don;t agree with both of them, means I've some pre conceived thoughts already. Now the task is to compile all of them into single piece of work. As you can confirm from the rambling in this paragraph. Let me start. I need a system to solve the above problem. A way to compare, contradict and compile the single source of truth, my truth. I also need another system. A system to collect all my pre existing knowledge and adjust it to my newly found truth. You might be knowing about my plan to self learn the business skills instead of going to college. Problem with business books is, most of the books have same few ideas, with different point of views. We can't blame them, as there is no single skill called Business and people from multiple discipline form their knowledge based on their own experiences and needs, and No two people are same. Let the past things past, I need a way to catalogue and index the ideas I'm learning now. SO tnat when I face a similar concept in the future, I can either connect it with my existing knowledge or contradict and have a rational discussion based on it. Charlie Munger is an huge inspiration for me and for may others. One of the important quality he have is to evaluate the business deals he comes across in less that 60 seconds. You may know about his business partner, Warren Buffett. While we may not be able to take billion dollar investments under 60 seconds, we all have to take decisions on daily basis. Even a smaller things like when to pay phone bill. There are two options, either I can pay it now, or I can wait til the last day. If I choose second option, I've got a problem. I've to remember the last date. I'm too lazy to spend 10 seconds to make aremainder in my phone. At that time, I'll think I can remember anything. I can even remember the colour of my shirt I wore on my 10th Birthday. Funny fact is I've trouble remembering what I ate for breakfast today, That took me more than 30 seconds. As I said, I want to be like Charlie Munger and all his worldly wisdoms. When asked, Munger pointed out the reason for his efficiency is something called his Latticework of Mental Models . He never listed out what are the mental models he's using, I got caught on the idea of Mental Models. Next time I've heard about the mental model is from Naval Ravikant, another successful investor. But the working nature of both the personalities are vastly different. Munger invests in well established publicly trading companies like Apple and Coca-Cola. Naval is an early stage investor who funds exclusivly for startups. The third time I've came across the same idea is from totally unexpected place. A professor from Germany used the system called Zettelkasten to publish around 70 books and 100 of articles. Let me point out the common things between all those ideas below. But feel free to omit or add you own stuff to sui your needs.

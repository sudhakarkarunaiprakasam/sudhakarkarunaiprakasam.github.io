Nearly 2 lakh people liked the tweet. The series of tweets then turned into a podcast and then Eric Jorgenson expanded them into a book. After so many recommendations, I\u2019ve bought the book 4 months back, even after reading the e-book and listening to 3 hour long podcast by Naval himself. I want to summarize the main theme of the book in this post. But I strongly recommend reading the book. Some books can alter the way we think about nearly everything in our life and Naval and Eric managed to do this in the book ( click here to get free e-book). Here we go!! Wealth Wealth is not just Money or Status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth can be anything from our bank interest to investment we hold on other companies. Bank Interest may be lowest utilization of wealth as it may not grow once you adjust inflation. One thing Naval reiterates is you cannot be rich just by having a high paying job. Even Doctors and Consultants earn only by hours and they cannot earn money while taking vacation or on their retirement. People who get rich are often own a piece of business, either by investing money in companies or start their own. But even a professional money manager have tough time to find investment due to high stock prices or low quality companies. And entrepreneurship have notoriously high failure rates. Path to wealth and financial independence is not so easy. Here Naval gives some specific markers to search for wealth in particular ways. Specific Knowledge We first have to understand that getting a job or starting a business in unrelated trending fields is not a correct way to go. For an young graduate starting a career, they have to spend next 30+ years doing almost same work in same industry. If we are selecting the industry or job based on current trend, either we may loose interested or the industry may fallen out of trend. Either way it is difficult to move on later in our life. Naval advocates heavily on the finding out our Specific Knowledge. The skill that is our own, something like our innate talent, genuine curiosity, or passion. Easy way to figure out our specific knowledge is to think deeply about what we used to like doing in our childhood, or to ask our family and friends that what we like to do effortlessly all the time. One important quality for specific knowledge is it should feel like play to us and work to others. In that way we can do that work 16 hours a day for 30+ years without getting bored and other people cannot compete with us. If you find the specific knowledge that you might get bored on later in life, ignore and just move on to next skill. If society can teach you to do something, it can teach others or computer to do it and replace you. Naval Ravikant Let me give an example of my specific knowledge. Since very young age, I was interested in reading books and newspapers. I can read non-fiction all day long without getting bored. Of course many people love to read, especially if they lived in a house without TV like me. I found out that difficult lesson once I got my laptop. But that is not my specific knowledge. My Specific Skill is ability to gather large amount of information and synthesis into usable narrative. I\u2019m a full time thing explainer for people around me and I love being so. Even this blog is a form of same thing, leveraged. Leverage Once we figure out our specific knowledge, next thing is to figure out how we can leverage it. Leverage is the force multiplier for whatever we do with our skills. We live in a world of infinite leverage. In a click of a button, I can send this post worldwide. Leverage is not an abstract concept. We are using leverage from the beginning of the human civilization. Through agriculture, we multiplied our food grains. Lets talk about leverage in wealth sense. There are 4 forms of leverage that Naval highlights in his book. Labour Money Code Media Labour and Money are classical forms of leverage. If you have ability to manage labour (leadership) and money, you can get very wealthy. Most of the wealthy people of past century used this way. But they require permission and validation from others. Like you can manage labour only if people choose to work for you (like every politician ever), you can manage money only if people give it to you (like Warren Buffet). Code and Media are new forms of leverage that Naval calls as permission-less leverage. Amazon and Google wrote code once and make their data centres work for them day in and out. This blog is a form of media where I get to write once and everybody get to read it. In early days, I\u2019ve to write it by hand and few people may get to read it. Then I\u2019ve to repeat the process. Without leverage, you cannot scale it. Whatever you\u2019re good at doing, it is important to scale it to global level to get wealthy. Accountability Naval calls it as Taking risks under one\u2019s own name and I call it Building in public. Be accountable for all your actions and put your name out there for all people to assess. People call it even negative publicity is still a publicity. You can have specific knowledge and leverage to create huge wealth. But how do you plan to capture it for you. It is by getting your name out there. If the effort is honest and still you failed, nobody will blame you. In some cases, they even support you for your next attempt. For example, take Tesla. In the past decade, the car company have issues like production delay. Even now, we are yet to receive Elon Musk\u2019s promise on fully autonomous driving. But his efforts are honest, paired with hard work of thousands of employees and robots. People understood the quality of his efforts and he get to be the wealthiest person on the planet. Judgement Specific knowledge, Leverage and Accountability are these won\u2019t make you wealthy, if you are bad at making judgement. An average stock trader i know makes 10 traders a week minimum while Warren Buffet makes around 10 investments probably in a year. The results of their judgements are for entire world to see. At higher level, like CEO or Founder, a 5% better judgement will make millions. That is why they are highly paid. Focus on the topics discussed above and customize them for yourself and get wealthy. Let me end with my favourite quote of Naval Ravikant. Fast, lift, sprint, stretch, and meditate. Build, sell, write, create, invest, and own. Read, reflect, love, seek truth, and ignore society. Make these habits. Say no to everything else. Avoid debt, jail, addiction, disgrace, shortcuts, and media. Relax. Victory is assured.

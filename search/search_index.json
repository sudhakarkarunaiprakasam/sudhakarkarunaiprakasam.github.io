If you ask about passion, almost everyone will say about arts, sports, etc. No one is passionate about being a office clerk or assistant. Yet we all (like 99%) end up working in those boring jobs all our life. It is not that we are not failures. It doesn't mean we can't do well in our profession. In fact for me, my interest in my day job increased after I've completed one year already. Now I'm happy with the work I do, the same work I've picked up as my last option. Passion is for Losers, as Scott Adams would say in his book . Instead focus on Economically Valuable Skills . List of those skills are available from Scott Adams , Naval Ravikant & Personal MBA . How to go about getting these skills is the real challenge. As I mentioned before, we don't know what work we like unless we try it. But we can't try all the jobs available. As Steve Jobs said, \" We can connect the dots only looking backwards. \" One idea to collect the skills is to find a base skill. As per Scott Adams & Naval Ravikant, this is the things we like to do when we were young. I'm talking about passion. But only as a base skill over which we can build a career. After finding your own base skill, you should find other skills or areas adjacent to that. According to Scott Adams, Every additional skill we acquire will double our odds of success. In this book, Cal Newport talks about those skills as our own Career Capital. The main advantage of career capital is almost all the innovations in our field happens at the edge of the knowledge and where one field connects with another. That is why most of the critical innovations are invented by two or more people around the same time. The real value of career capital is our ability to bring ideas from one field and apply it in other. Next point the book makes is about Craftsmanship. It is not enough if we only become competent in our skills. Almost all the action takes place in bleeding edge of the knowledge in that field. We can go about becoming better at what we do is only by Deliberate Practice. As Malcolm Gladwell would say, it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something. Once we have enough Career Capital, we have to focus on making the mark in the world on our own. There are two important control traps we should avoid as per the author. We should not start on our own before acquiring enough career capital. Once we have enough competence, the people we work for won't simple allow us to resign and start our own shop. Try to navigate without burning any bridge. Having an unifying mission is the best way to go about our venture. We can connect the dots only looking backward, as already mentioned. Next thing after collecting the career skills, we should start with Small Bets. The magic of thinking big may sound attractive at first sight. But we cannot make a mark unless we have experience. So start with small bets and get gradually bigger ones. Along the way, we have to talk about marketing our self, as it is very important in the social media age to attract the necessary friends or partners to work with. Notes Don't follow your passion . Become a Career Capitalist . Career Capital is Set of Rare and Economically Valuable Skills . Work like a Craftsman ( Deliberate Practice) . Navigate carefully around Control Traps . Have a Mission. Missions require Capital, Small Bets, Marketing .","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport"},{"location":"soGoodTheyCantIgnore/#so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-by-cal-newport","text":"","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport"},{"location":"soGoodTheyCantIgnore/#summary","text":"Following your own passion is overrated.

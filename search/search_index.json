Writing my thoughts out makes sense, but publishing them in Linkedin and Twitter doesn't. They are headless and wandering too much. It is expected to be so, just that it's not going to be useful for others. So, Essays are the only things that I'm going to show the people. Anyway all parts of the website is in public view, just that I'm not going to advertise daily. The intended workflow for my digital garden is BookNotes , MentalModels and then finally Essays . This is to mimic the Zettelkasten with Fleeting Notes, Permanent Notes and finally Published works. Will wait and see how this is going to pan out. I'm not happy with managing hundreds of standalone notes in my system, all in one page is easily manageable. The restrictions are there like connecting multiple ideas. Will try to sort out as much as possible. Just that reading Naval Ravikant, Charlie Munger, I expect my models to be simple and easy to maintain for me to use it. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 13/June/2022 12/June/2022_Sunday \"It doesn't take much to feel good about yourself\" -- Jim Carry Do little things that can add up in the long run. It doesn't take too much to do few small things that make us happy, proud. They do add up, over the weeks and months and once it gathers enough critical value, it will blow up, exponentially. Leonardo Da Vinci maintained over 7000 pages of notes and drawings and he finished very few paintings in his lifetime. But all those 7000 pages taken throughout his lifetime made his finished paintings into masterpieces. As Naval Ravikant would say \"99% of effort is wasted\". But it is very difficult to find out 1% at the beginning. We can find them out only through sticking out neck deeply into the work we are doing. Once we find out the 1% topic, we can let go all others. In the long run, all things add up. Believe in compound effect in all aspects of life. Note: Streak is set to 1 as I missed writing yesterday. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 12/June/2022 10/June/2022_Friday Nobody likes to change, right. As much as we proclaim about our ability to transform, we don't intentionally do it. It is true at least for me. I hate changes, both positive and negative. I like to stay same place, doing same thing for hours at a stretch and happy doing same thing every day for years. That's a bad thing, I know. Being an introvert doesn't do any favour with changing environment. Writing this blog is not so easy for me. Yet, I'm choosing to do so, for the past 6 days. I've started this blog 6 months before. Nobody knows this, even I don't know. I was deleting the blog, changing the fonts, background colour, adding Newsletter etc. Every time I change something, I'll delete everything and start again. After lot of changes and 6 months later, I want to stick to the basics. I chose simple and manageable website template I could find. I'm hosting them myself using GitHub Pages. I didn't want to complicate my process with lots of plans and schedule. As of now, I'll write about things I'm thinking at the moment of writing and let it be. Posting them in Twitter and Linkedin is just for accountability sake. Only two metrics I count are my continuous writing streak (6 till today) and how many words I'm writing till the end of this year. I don't expect these things will take me to any place. I just want to write this blog, just for writing sake. This is big thing for me, as this is the first time, I'm doing something without expecting anything in return. \u201cI can do hard things. Doing hard things has intrinsic value, and they will make me a better person, even if I end up failing.\u201d -- Brandon Sanderson Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 10/June/2022 09/June/2022_Thursday On Investing For today's blog I'd like to continue with my discussion about Cal Newport's the people who are most likely to thrive in the digital age, namely investors and superstars in their respective field. The two categories of people may look different in the bird's eye view. But they more interconnected if we care to look closely. Technical Superstars are the people who heavily invested in themselves through practice and reaping the rewards at the current time. The investors life is not so glamorous as it looks in the plain sight. Sales people know it is very difficult to extract even 10 Rupees from people, yet Investors we know manage crores. The only way to get this place is by gaining trust and permission from lots of folks. In short, they have to be superstars in the investing space taking years of contrarian bets and win confidence from people. I'm taking Prof. Aswath Damodaran's Corporate Finance class. The most important decisions a business have to take are related to Investment, Financing, and Dividend. I'd like to apply these concepts one by one on the individual person. On Investing, an individual is already investing 20+ years in acquiring the knowledge. But one very crucial distinction between companies and individual is the order of investing. For example, a company like Amazon started as a online book store, then they expanded into full blown e-commerce company. Since then they explored and gained foothold in the cloud and media business. Shortly, they specialized first and then only expanded their business to multiple adjacent fields based on their learnings. This is applicable to any modern companies following Lean Principle. On contrary, Individuals invest very differently. Out of ~15/16 years of education, we first invest in learning about wide range of things, lot of abstract concepts with very less practical knowledge. At some point, we have to choose one field to specialize, even without understanding the practical applications and have to live with our decision for our entire career. Obviously exceptions are also there, but not enough. To drive my point home, people are okay with the idea Apple becoming a finance company, But they dismiss the idea of an engineer become lawyer or vice versa. \" Specialization is for insects. \" -- Robert Heinlein Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 09/June/2022 08/June/2022_Wednesday Kamal Haasan's Vikram released few days back and it is becoming the most successful movie for him in decades. One thing that people were repeating before and after the release of the movie is how he didn't involve in the screenplay, despite being the producer how he gave similar screen space for other actors. I've been thinking whether these two observations are relevant to the outcome. One movie is too small sample size to infer anything and also I think there are for more actors who don't or can't involve in the story discussion and the outcomes of those movies are random. The point I'm interested in is similar to my yesterday's blog. The people who are most likely to thrive are either Specialists or Investors. Kamal Haasan in all his career have been in the specialist zone. He started acting as 6yo child artist and 60 years later he is still here wanting to learn more. Here I'm thinking about reading some books or getting a degree will improve my understanding about things going on around me. Silly me. Coming back to the point, he is changing his role from Specialist to an Investor, I believe. Not saying that because he produced the movie. That too, but the primary reason for my opinion is he started believing in people and delegating the work to them, I believe. More like a venture capitalist or angel investor, he picked up a talented and hardworking team who are in the verge of a breakthrough and made his bet. Now he's counting on his bank balance. Good thought to have in my head for a day. Will continue to explore the topic of whether to become Specialist or Generalist. As of now my mind want me to be a generalist. Will get myself more clarity in the coming days. Note: Even without this movie, he had a wonderful career that inspire people to do follow their passion and to do lot of experiments along the way. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 08/June/2022 07/June/2022_Tuesday For the monkey mind, there are million things to do at any point of time and a million different idea on how to do each one. My current plan to beat my monkey mind is to limit the options. Like Naval Ravikant said, I would like to focus on One Big Project for the time being. The One Thing in front of me at the current point of time is build my latticework of mental models and general decision making skills. The kind of people most likely to thrive on digital age (Cal Newport on Deep Work) are, 1. Superstars in their respective fields, 2. People who can work with Intelligent Machines, 3. Investors who can invest in above people and companies The first one is practically closed for my sake, since I'm working in a well developed field where I've to catch up lot of technical things. Catching up with technical knowledge is not good move for me since I was never a number-cruncher and I don't think I can make it to the top. The third option is out of reach for me at this point of time due to lack of capital. But this is the aspirational career for me in the future. One thing I'm doing well in the recent past is catching up with current technological trends and reading more about them. Also I have a huge FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) towards the topics like Data Science and Product Management. As Aswath Damodaran use to group up his students, I think I belong to the group of Number Crunchers who want to become storyteller. Will see how this journey goes. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 07/June/2022 06/June/2022_Monday Escape competition through Authenticity - Naval Ravikant Ever since pandemic, most of my mind is occupied by the reality that we are all replaceable, at least in the professional life. As soon as the pandemic hits, my project was shelved and I had to move to another related domain and learn lot of new things from scratch. My parents had to close their hotel business due to lockdown. I know people who are having their 2 meals everyday for 2-3 years in my parents shop. But no-one missed them when they closed up the shop. I'm sure their customers lives also changed and in a way almost everybody and everyone. Changing projects, teams, domains are small things in a career of 30+ years. But this was the first time I had to face. All the commitments and due dates vanished in a second. All the good work I've done over the years are gone, without any trace. Of course I get to keep the knowledge and memories. Only thought I'm repeating everyday is Don't be replaceable. I strongly believe this blog is one of the way to get there. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 06/June/2022 05/June/2022_Sunday Things are changing very quickly. I was reading the Lean Startup for the past 3-4 days. I stopped reading maybe around 20%. Book is good, don't mistake me. It is the foundational book into the field of Product Management. Just that the book repeats about Build, Measure & Learn Feedback loop so much so that I want to start building things soon. So the current plan is to complete the core business books in my reading list about Corporate Finance, Valuation, Economics. Also I intend to learn more about mental models. The relevant books I have are Personal MBA, The Great Mental Models, The Model Thinker. Plans change, especially for me it changes very frequently. The end goal is same, to understand the inner working of the world with economic & psychologic lens, to improve my decision making skills. Current approach is little bit shorter and get to the depth very quickly. I must get ready to do hard things, in the self learning journey. Will do as much a possible. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 05/June/2022 01/June/2022_Wednesday Nothing much to say, except I'm starting from scratch for maybe 10th time in these 6 months. It is tiring for me also. I'm having huge imposter syndrome every other day and trying to change something. One behavioral trait I've had since childhood is scraping the unfinished thing and starting from scratch. In office too, when a question came up about correcting the mistakes in the document, I said I'll delete and recreate again. Too bad of a habit in the world of product iteration, incremental improvement, etc. This habit is going to hurt me in the long run since the things I want to do now are not possible to recreate that easily. For example, when I take this blog with couple of posts, I don't mind deleting it and rework on it. But once I have more than maybe 10 posts, the loss of them going to be significant. So let me do that thing first. Populate this blog with more posts, such that I cannot lose them. For a start, I'm going to blog daily for the month of June. Don't expect high value information on any of them, even after June. For now, the daily blog format is going to be some of the personal and professional things happening that particular day. This is based on Mathew Dicks Homework for Life . Next part is about the things I'm learning about during the day or two. For example, I'm reading about product management recently. I'm going to complete The Lean Startup , The Lean Product Playbook and a course on Software Product Development . Will see how it goes.

The third option is out of reach for me at this point of time due to lack of capital. But this is the aspirational career for me in the future. One thing I'm doing well in the recent past is catching up with current technological trends and reading more about them. Also I have a huge FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) towards the topics like Data Science and Product Management. As Aswath Damodaran use to group up his students, I think I belong to the group of Number Crunchers who want to become storyteller. Will see how this journey goes.

As soon as the pandemic hits, my project was shelved and I had to move to another related domain and learn lot of new things from scratch. My parents had to close their hotel business due to lockdown. I know people who are having their 2 meals everyday for 2-3 years in my parents shop. But no-one missed them when they closed up the shop. I'm sure their customers lives also changed and in a way almost everybody and everyone. Changing projects, teams, domains are small things in a career of 30+ years. But this was the first time I had to face. All the commitments and due dates vanished in a second. All the good work I've done over the years are gone, without any trace. Of course I get to keep the knowledge and memories. Only thought I'm repeating everyday is Don't be replaceable. I strongly believe this blog is one of the way to get there.

I was reading the Lean Startup for the past 3-4 days. I stopped reading maybe around 20%. Book is good, don't mistake me. It is the foundational book into the field of Product Management. Just that the book repeats about Build, Measure & Learn Feedback loop so much so that I want to start building things soon. So the current plan is to complete the core business books in my reading list about Corporate Finance, Valuation, Economics. Also I intend to learn more about mental models. The relevant books I have are Personal MBA, The Great Mental Models, The Model Thinker. Plans change, especially for me it changes very frequently. The end goal is same, to understand the inner working of the world with economic & psychologic lens, to improve my decision making skills. Current approach is little bit shorter and get to the depth very quickly. I must get ready to do hard things, in the self learning journey. Will do as much a possible.

It is tiring for me also. I'm having huge imposter syndrome every other day and trying to change something. One behavioral trait I've had since childhood is scraping the unfinished thing and starting from scratch. In office too, when a question came up about correcting the mistakes in the document, I said I'll delete and recreate again. Too bad of a habit in the world of product iteration, incremental improvement, etc. This habit is going to hurt me in the long run since the things I want to do now are not possible to recreate that easily. For example, when I take this blog with couple of posts, I don't mind deleting it and rework on it. But once I have more than maybe 10 posts, the loss of them going to be significant. So let me do that thing first. Populate this blog with more posts, such that I cannot lose them. For a start, I'm going to blog daily for the month of June. Don't expect high value information on any of them, even after June. For now, the daily blog format is going to be some of the personal and professional things happening that particular day. This is based on Mathew Dicks Homework for Life . Next part is about the things I'm learning about during the day or two. For example, I'm reading about product management recently. I'm going to complete The Lean Startup , The Lean Product Playbook and a course on Software Product Development . Will see how it goes.

Those are formed based on out life experiences and unique for every individual. The mental models are the shortcuts, flowcharts or simplified view of the system we use to make decisions. Mental model could be anything and everything. For example, I mostly drive my bike at 50-60 kmph speed even in highways. I feel in that speed I can control the bike most of the cases. This is the mental model for my driving. It could be different for different people. Advantages: It helps with making decisions quickly. Charlie Munger reportedly can make business decisions within a minute it is presented with the help of his latticework of mental models. Once we get better at the process of decision making with mental models, we can have more leverage. Challenges One model thinking may not work that well and which model to apply is not so straight forward. Need to have lot of mental models and apply them in various combinations to get effective output. Need to get feedback and iterate for long time to get better at the process. Acquiring New Skills Refer Naval Ravikant, Cal Newport The kind of people most likely to thrive in the digital economy are, Superstars one their fields People who can work well with technologies to produce outputs, Investors and Venture Capitalists who can spot the trend. The most important quality required to thrive in this economy is the ability to learn things quickly and ability to produce at the highest quality. Most of the technologies get to their peak in years and go out of trend less than a decade. We should develop our ability to perform at the professional level within few months and we can get very rich within few years. But the technology will go down quickly and we should be ready to repeat the process many times throughout our career. It is directly opposite to the previous generation where people figure out the things they are good at and do the same job till they retire. Skill Stacking Refer Scott Adams, Josh Kaufman, Naval Ravikant As discussed already, we should learn and produce output using new technologies quickly and we can earn big bucks. There are some reservations with this approach because there are lot of things are one trend at any particular moment. For example, the current trending topics are DeFi, Web3, Cloud, Machine Learning, etc. In this kind of situation how can one person go about picking new skills. As Scott Adams calls it, Talent Stacking is the way where we can be decently skilled at few adjacent fields such a way that we can be best at what we do. We can combine our average level skills strategically to be top most person at one particular combination of skills. Some of the skills Scott Adams recommends people to get good are Persuasion, Public Speaking, Psychology, Business Writing, Technology, Overcoming Shyness, etc. \"Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.\" - Naval Ravikant In Personal MBA, Josh Kaufman classifies the Business into five parts, Value Creation Marketing Sales Value Delivery Finance The skills relevant to those 5 areas of business can be financially rewarding. We can't get rich by the skills that support other areas of business like supporting departments like maintenance, administration, etc. One important thing we need to know about the skill before picking up is to understand how scalable it is. A programmer can right a piece of code and automate it with very less cost. The content creator can share the content they produce worldwide without any marginal cost of replication. Corporate Finance First Principles Refer Aswath Damodaran, Josh Kaufman \"It's all Corporate Finance\" - Aswath Damodaran Every decision in a business involves money and any decision that affects money is a corporate finance decision. Cash is the blood that runs the business (I've heard people say it is Free Cash Flow, I need to learn further on the topic). In Josh Kaufman's 5 parts of Business, Finance is the one that runs all others. All the decisions are taken based on the money one business have/can invest and what it is willing to gain? The three important finance decisions a business need to take are, Investment Decision (Risk vs Return) Financing Decision (Debt vs Equity) Dividend Decision (Buyback vs Dividend) All those decisions are guided by single objective of the business, that is what the business wants to do? Corporate Finance Objective Refer Aswath Damodaran The reason the business exists and people work for it day and night is to make money. Helping Society should be part of the package, but not at the cost of profit. The objective of the corporate finance is to maximize the value of the firm . We can interpret the above objective in many different ways and each business interpret in their own way. We can maximize the value of the business by increasing market share, revenue, profit margin, customer satisfaction, etc. We can improve productivity by giving better incentives to employees. We can do good to society along the way and extract the good will in the form of business. There are lot of stakeholders and lot of ways to increase the value of the firm. But the problem in the real world is we can't focus on multiple ways as they are contradicting one another. We cannot satisfy all the stakeholders and we must clearly pick one single objective and work on it.","title":"Mental Models"},{"location":"MentalModels/#mental-models","text":"","title":"Mental Models"},{"location":"MentalModels/#on-mental-models","text":"Refer Shane Parrish, Scott Page, Josh Kaufman We all have mental models in out head.

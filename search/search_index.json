It is tiring for me also. I'm having huge imposter syndrome every other day and trying to change something. One behavioural trait I've had since childhood is scraping the unfinished thing and starting from scratch. In office too, when a question came up about correcting the mistakes in the document, I said I'll delete and recreate again. Too bad of a habit in the world of product iteration, incremental improvement, etc. This habit is going to hurt me in the long run since the things I want to do now are not possible to recreate that easily. For example, when I take this blog with couple of posts, I don't mind deleting it and rework on it. But once I have more than maybe 10 posts, the loss of them going to be significant. So let me do that thing first. Populate this blog with more posts, such that I cannot lose them. For a start, I'm going to blog daily for the month of June. Don't expect high value informations on any of them, even after June. For now, the daily blog format is going to be some of the personal and professional things happening that particular day. This is based on Mathew Dicks Homework for Life . Next part is about the things I'm learning about during the day or two. For example, I'm reading about product management recently. I'm going to complete The Lean Startup , The Lean Product Playbook and a course on Software Product Development . Will see how it goes.

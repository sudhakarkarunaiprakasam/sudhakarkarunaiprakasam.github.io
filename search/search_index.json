Some of them may become essays when they have enough critical mass. Feel free to browse around. So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport A very good book. Cleared up lot of things for me. All those things I'm trying for past few months in my blog, twitter, everything started to explore the concept called Value . Simply put, I want to find out how I can make a life other than being a faceless crew member in a corporate company. The book may not direct me towards finding those values, it set a good starting point. The book started with a controversial opinion. Cal Newport states \"Don't follow your passion\" with a good enough examples. One thing I'm not able to understand is his interpretation of Steve Jobs. I think Steve Jobs male similar point about passion when he says \"We can only connect the dots only looking backwards\". Why we should not follow our passion? Well, passion is not for everyone. Everybody is passionate about being a olympian, an actor or musician. The problem with those careers is very few can truly make it to the top. It is designed that way. The top musicians, athletes get paid in millions along with those medals and awards. But the other 99% lives their lives in not so good situation. On the other hand, the people once find out passion is over rated and moved to boring day jobs that paid decently are either constantly stressed or spend their life feeling not contributing anything to anyone. I'm one of them who wake up and go to bed feeling worthless. Don't mistake me, I'm doing an average contribution by being a half decent engineer. But being a part of a thousands of team members, my actual contribution ends up to just a rounding error. I can do more important things. But unlike computer geeks, I don't have the infrastructure to use just my laptop and internet to create some hobby projects. The tools we use cost lakhs and cannot be used for hobby (in most cases). So I had to find out other things I'm good at. I did a little look back into my past and understood the things I'm better at and things I like doing. Both of them are same. Author found out the same by reading lot of researches. We get good at things once we gain enough experience and confident about doing it on our own. We cannot figure it out beforehand, except maybe very few young prodigies.","title":"Worldly Wisdom"},{"location":"worldlyWisdom/#worldly-wisdom","text":"All the things I'm writing here is to clarify myself.

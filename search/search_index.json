On How to get Rich Short summary of The Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson Wealth = Specific Knowledge + Accountability + Leverage Wealth is the asset that can earn while we sleep. Wealth is fundamentally different from Status & Money. Money is your bank balance that is loosing its value due to inflation. Status is the game we used to play for gallery for moral high ground instead of well being of oneself and others. Specific Knowledge is the innate talent, passion or the thing we like & do well. Specific Knowledge is our favourite hobby that other people are willing to pay for. To make other pay, we need to apply our skills in a way it provides value to the people. As long as we are good at our chosen field and enjoy putting more productive time into it, people will pay willingly. The specific knowledge is not necessarily a single skill. It can be a collection of skills that are combined to provide a single form of value to the customer. For example, Scott Adams is an average cartoonist. But when he combined it with his bank/corporate experience, persuasion, witty one liners, he is the best talent in his field. Scott Adams calls this process as Talent Stacking . Accountability People pay more for branded things in a hope that it is a quality product. Trust is the most important thing in business and even in real life. Almost all the things in personal life, career have compound effect built into it. The only way to attract the compound effect into our life is by being accountable. Being accountable doesn't mean going out of the way to help people. We can establish accountability simply by making the promise and keeping them unbroken. For example, I hereby promise I'm going to write everyday till end of this year. Leverage Specific Knowledge helps you enter the market, Accountability helps you be in the market without being left out. In other words, we can create value with the help of Specific Knowledge and deliver the promised value aka Accountability. These two qualities will help us pay the bills, but it may not account for more than that. When you combine those two qualities with Leverage, you can grow exponentially. The common forms of leverage are Capital, Labour, Code, Media. Choose the one based on your preference and you are good to go.

Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 17/June/2022 On Mental Models From Shane Parrish & Prof. Scott Page Mental models are mathematical formulae or blueprints that help us understand the world around us. No two people can interpret one event in the same manner. We are all as good as the lens we use. The mental models are the lenses we use to understand the working of the complex systems like organizations, or even entire world. Thanks to people like Charlie Munger, Daniel Kahneman, etc, there are several studies appearing on social media so that I can learn more of them. Especially during the pandemic, scientists and governments spend lot of time modelling the viral growth and prescribed actions based on that. There are several advantages with thinking with mental models. One is the models are simple enough to remember and apply without the need for complex calculations. Other is to look back and reflect the outcome and adapt based on the feedback. When we formalize the model with specific inputs and expected outcome, based on the actual performance, we can always come back and update the model. Some problems when we create our own models: Some of the models that we form based on our experience cannot be formalized. They cannot be written down on paper with logic. For example, I've the fear that If I sleep below the ceiling fan, it may fall over me. The moment I write down the statement, I know the irrational fear behind it. Odds of the event happening is so low and the odds of the event happening to me is much lower that that and the odds of the event happening to me today is near to zero. But I created this model most probably in my childhood based on some news or gossip. Some of those irrational false models also can be useful, but it is better to write them down and understand the logic before applying.","title":"Collected Dots"},{"location":"CollectedDots/#collected-dots","text":"\"Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.\" - Naval Ravikant This is the single place to collect and store the mental models I'm exploring.

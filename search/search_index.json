As soon as the pandemic hits, my project was shelved and I had to move to another related domain and learn lot of new things from scratch. My parents had to close their hotel business due to lockdown. I know people who are having their 2 meals everyday for 2-3 years in my parents shop. But no-one missed them when they closed up the shop. I'm sure their customers lives also changed and in a way almost everybody and everyone. Changing projects, teams, domains are small things in a career of 30+ years. But this was the first time I had to face. All the commitments and due dates vanished in a second. All the good work I've done over the years are gone, without any trace. Of course I get to keep the knowledge and memories. Only thought I'm repeating everyday is Don't be replaceable. I strongly believe this blog is one of the way to get there. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 06/June/2022 05/June/2022_Sunday Things are changing very quickly. I was reading the Lean Startup for the past 3-4 days. I stopped reading maybe around 20%. Book is good, don't mistake me. It is the foundational book into the field of Product Management. Just that the book repeats about Build, Measure & Learn Feedback loop so much so that I want to start building things soon. So the current plan is to complete the core business books in my reading list about Corporate Finance, Valuation, Economics. Also I intend to learn more about mental models. The relevant books I have are Personal MBA, The Great Mental Models, The Model Thinker. Plans change, especially for me it changes very frequently. The end goal is same, to understand the inner working of the world with economic & psychologic lens, to improve my decision making skills. Current approach is little bit shorter and get to the depth very quickly. I must get ready to do hard things, in the self learning journey. Will do as much a possible. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 05/June/2022 01/June/2022_Wednesday Nothing much to say, except I'm starting from scratch for maybe 10th time in these 6 months. It is tiring for me also. I'm having huge imposter syndrome every other day and trying to change something. One behavioral trait I've had since childhood is scraping the unfinished thing and starting from scratch. In office too, when a question came up about correcting the mistakes in the document, I said I'll delete and recreate again. Too bad of a habit in the world of product iteration, incremental improvement, etc. This habit is going to hurt me in the long run since the things I want to do now are not possible to recreate that easily. For example, when I take this blog with couple of posts, I don't mind deleting it and rework on it. But once I have more than maybe 10 posts, the loss of them going to be significant. So let me do that thing first. Populate this blog with more posts, such that I cannot lose them. For a start, I'm going to blog daily for the month of June. Don't expect high value information on any of them, even after June. For now, the daily blog format is going to be some of the personal and professional things happening that particular day. This is based on Mathew Dicks Homework for Life . Next part is about the things I'm learning about during the day or two. For example, I'm reading about product management recently. I'm going to complete The Lean Startup , The Lean Product Playbook and a course on Software Product Development . Will see how it goes.

As much as we proclaim about our ability to transform, we don't intentionally do it. It is true at least for me. I hate changes, both positive and negative. I like to stay same place, doing same thing for hours at a stretch and happy doing same thing every day for years. That's a bad thing, I know. Being an introvert doesn't do any favour with changing environment. Writing this blog is not so easy for me. Yet, I'm choosing to do so, for the past 6 days. I've started this blog 6 months before. Nobody knows this, even I don't know. I was deleting the blog, changing the fonts, background colour, adding Newsletter etc. Every time I change something, I'll delete everything and start again. After lot of changes and 6 months later, I want to stick to the basics. I chose simple and manageable website template I could find. I'm hosting them myself using GitHub Pages. I didn't want to complicate my process with lots of plans and schedule. As of now, I'll write about things I'm thinking at the moment of writing and let it be. Posting them in Twitter and Linkedin is just for accountability sake. Only two metrics I count are my continuous writing streak (6 till today) and how many words I'm writing till the end of this year. I don't expect these things will take me to any place. I just want to write this blog, just for writing sake. This is big thing for me, as this is the first time, I'm doing something without expecting anything in return. \u201cI can do hard things. Doing hard things has intrinsic value, and they will make me a better person, even if I end up failing.\u201d -- Brandon Sanderson Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 10/June/2022 09/June/2022_Thursday On Investing For today's blog I'd like to continue with my discussion about Cal Newport's the people who are most likely to thrive in the digital age, namely investors and superstars in their respective field. The two categories of people may look different in the bird's eye view. But they more interconnected if we care to look closely. Technical Superstars are the people who heavily invested in themselves through practice and reaping the rewards at the current time. The investors life is not so glamorous as it looks in the plain sight. Sales people know it is very difficult to extract even 10 Rupees from people, yet Investors we know manage crores. The only way to get this place is by gaining trust and permission from lots of folks. In short, they have to be superstars in the investing space taking years of contrarian bets and win confidence from people. I'm taking Prof. Aswath Damodaran's Corporate Finance class. The most important decisions a business have to take are related to Investment, Financing, and Dividend. I'd like to apply these concepts one by one on the individual person. On Investing, an individual is already investing 20+ years in acquiring the knowledge. But one very crucial distinction between companies and individual is the order of investing. For example, a company like Amazon started as a online book store, then they expanded into full blown e-commerce company. Since then they explored and gained foothold in the cloud and media business. Shortly, they specialized first and then only expanded their business to multiple adjacent fields based on their learnings. This is applicable to any modern companies following Lean Principle. On contrary, Individuals invest very differently. Out of ~15/16 years of education, we first invest in learning about wide range of things, lot of abstract concepts with very less practical knowledge. At some point, we have to choose one field to specialize, even without understanding the practical applications and have to live with our decision for our entire career. Obviously exceptions are also there, but not enough. To drive my point home, people are okay with the idea Apple becoming a finance company, But they dismiss the idea of an engineer become lawyer or vice versa. \" Specialization is for insects. \" -- Robert Heinlein Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 09/June/2022 08/June/2022_Wednesday Kamal Haasan's Vikram released few days back and it is becoming the most successful movie for him in decades. One thing that people were repeating before and after the release of the movie is how he didn't involve in the screenplay, despite being the producer how he gave similar screen space for other actors. I've been thinking whether these two observations are relevant to the outcome. One movie is too small sample size to infer anything and also I think there are for more actors who don't or can't involve in the story discussion and the outcomes of those movies are random. The point I'm interested in is similar to my yesterday's blog. The people who are most likely to thrive are either Specialists or Investors. Kamal Haasan in all his career have been in the specialist zone. He started acting as 6yo child artist and 60 years later he is still here wanting to learn more. Here I'm thinking about reading some books or getting a degree will improve my understanding about things going on around me. Silly me. Coming back to the point, he is changing his role from Specialist to an Investor, I believe. Not saying that because he produced the movie. That too, but the primary reason for my opinion is he started believing in people and delegating the work to them, I believe. More like a venture capitalist or angel investor, he picked up a talented and hardworking team who are in the verge of a breakthrough and made his bet. Now he's counting on his bank balance. Good thought to have in my head for a day. Will continue to explore the topic of whether to become Specialist or Generalist. As of now my mind want me to be a generalist. Will get myself more clarity in the coming days. Note: Even without this movie, he had a wonderful career that inspire people to do follow their passion and to do lot of experiments along the way. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 08/June/2022 07/June/2022_Tuesday For the monkey mind, there are million things to do at any point of time and a million different idea on how to do each one. My current plan to beat my monkey mind is to limit the options. Like Naval Ravikant said, I would like to focus on One Big Project for the time being. The One Thing in front of me at the current point of time is build my latticework of mental models and general decision making skills. The kind of people most likely to thrive on digital age (Cal Newport on Deep Work) are, 1. Superstars in their respective fields, 2. People who can work with Intelligent Machines, 3. Investors who can invest in above people and companies The first one is practically closed for my sake, since I'm working in a well developed field where I've to catch up lot of technical things. Catching up with technical knowledge is not good move for me since I was never a number-cruncher and I don't think I can make it to the top. The third option is out of reach for me at this point of time due to lack of capital. But this is the aspirational career for me in the future. One thing I'm doing well in the recent past is catching up with current technological trends and reading more about them. Also I have a huge FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) towards the topics like Data Science and Product Management. As Aswath Damodaran use to group up his students, I think I belong to the group of Number Crunchers who want to become storyteller. Will see how this journey goes. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 07/June/2022 06/June/2022_Monday Escape competition through Authenticity - Naval Ravikant Ever since pandemic, most of my mind is occupied by the reality that we are all replaceable, at least in the professional life. As soon as the pandemic hits, my project was shelved and I had to move to another related domain and learn lot of new things from scratch. My parents had to close their hotel business due to lockdown. I know people who are having their 2 meals everyday for 2-3 years in my parents shop. But no-one missed them when they closed up the shop. I'm sure their customers lives also changed and in a way almost everybody and everyone. Changing projects, teams, domains are small things in a career of 30+ years. But this was the first time I had to face. All the commitments and due dates vanished in a second. All the good work I've done over the years are gone, without any trace. Of course I get to keep the knowledge and memories. Only thought I'm repeating everyday is Don't be replaceable. I strongly believe this blog is one of the way to get there. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 06/June/2022 05/June/2022_Sunday Things are changing very quickly. I was reading the Lean Startup for the past 3-4 days. I stopped reading maybe around 20%. Book is good, don't mistake me. It is the foundational book into the field of Product Management. Just that the book repeats about Build, Measure & Learn Feedback loop so much so that I want to start building things soon. So the current plan is to complete the core business books in my reading list about Corporate Finance, Valuation, Economics. Also I intend to learn more about mental models. The relevant books I have are Personal MBA, The Great Mental Models, The Model Thinker. Plans change, especially for me it changes very frequently. The end goal is same, to understand the inner working of the world with economic & psychologic lens, to improve my decision making skills. Current approach is little bit shorter and get to the depth very quickly. I must get ready to do hard things, in the self learning journey. Will do as much a possible. Sudhakar Karunaiprakasam, 05/June/2022 01/June/2022_Wednesday Nothing much to say, except I'm starting from scratch for maybe 10th time in these 6 months. It is tiring for me also. I'm having huge imposter syndrome every other day and trying to change something. One behavioral trait I've had since childhood is scraping the unfinished thing and starting from scratch. In office too, when a question came up about correcting the mistakes in the document, I said I'll delete and recreate again. Too bad of a habit in the world of product iteration, incremental improvement, etc. This habit is going to hurt me in the long run since the things I want to do now are not possible to recreate that easily. For example, when I take this blog with couple of posts, I don't mind deleting it and rework on it. But once I have more than maybe 10 posts, the loss of them going to be significant. So let me do that thing first. Populate this blog with more posts, such that I cannot lose them. For a start, I'm going to blog daily for the month of June. Don't expect high value information on any of them, even after June. For now, the daily blog format is going to be some of the personal and professional things happening that particular day. This is based on Mathew Dicks Homework for Life . Next part is about the things I'm learning about during the day or two. For example, I'm reading about product management recently. I'm going to complete The Lean Startup , The Lean Product Playbook and a course on Software Product Development . Will see how it goes.
